# mirror-yq

OCX mirror for [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). One repository, one spec
directory per package.

| Package | Spec | Publishes to | Announced as | Upstream SPDX |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) | [`yq/mirror.yml`](yq/mirror.yml) | `ghcr.io/ocx-contrib/yq/yq` | `ocx.sh/yq/yq` | `MIT` |

Each upstream release is discovered, re-bundled, smoke-tested per
`(version, platform)` and only then pushed with cascade tags, after which the
result is announced into the OCX index.

> This repository previously published the same upstream to the flat coordinate
> `ocx.sh/yq`. `yq/yq` is the grouped successor. Upstream's owner is the
> personal handle `mikefarah`, so the tool names itself rather than borrowing a
> person's account name.

## Layout

```
mirror-base.yml         repo-wide policy every spec inherits via `extends:`
yq/
├── mirror.yml          the spec — never at the repo root
├── metadata.json       bundle interface
├── CATALOG.md          → ocx package describe
├── logo.svg / logo.png describe assets, 512px PNG
└── tests/smoke.star    Starlark smoke test
```

`LICENSE` and `NOTICE.md` are shared at the root. Logos are **not** — each
package carries its own, because a repo-root `logo.*` sits in no workflow's
`paths:` filter, so replacing it would publish nothing until some unrelated
edit happened to fire.

⚠️ `extends:` is a **shallow** merge of top-level keys. A spec that restates
`platforms:` to change one runner drops every `containers:` entry with it, and
nothing reds — the legs simply stop existing, and every `os.features` claim
goes back to being asserted rather than verified. Restate a block in full or
not at all.

## Platforms

`yq` publishes six platform entries: both Linux arches, both macOS arches and
both Windows arches. Upstream builds yq as a pure-Go binary without cgo, so
there is one Linux build per arch and it is **fully static** — no `PT_INTERP`,
no `DT_NEEDED`, and no musl/glibc variants to choose between. `os.features`
states what an artifact requires *of the host*, so both Linux keys are
**bare**: tagging them `+libc.musl` would be a false requirement that hid them
from every glibc host. The `alpine:3.20` container leg in `mirror-base.yml` is
what turns that claim into evidence; the measurement itself is recorded above
the `assets:` block in `yq/mirror.yml`.

The version floor is `4.46.0` because `yq_windows_arm64.exe` first ships in
v4.45.2 — below it the spec would resolve five platforms and silently skip the
sixth.

## Editing

| File | Edit | Regenerate after |
|------|------|------------------|
| `mirror-base.yml`, `yq/mirror.yml` | hand | yes — see below |
| `yq/{metadata.json,CATALOG.md,logo.*}` | hand | — |
| `yq/tests/smoke.star` | hand | — |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` | **generated — never hand-edit** | re-run when a spec changes |

```bash
ocx-mirror package pipeline generate ci --spec yq/mirror.yml
```

**Name every spec.** `--spec` *appends* rather than replaces, so a command
naming a subset silently stops rendering the rest while staying green — and the
drift guard reds on a generated workflow the current spec set no longer
produces.

`verify-generated.yml` exits 65 on drift. If a generated workflow is wrong, the
spec or the renderer template is wrong — fix it there and regenerate.

Run `direnv allow` once to put the pinned toolchain on `PATH`, and invoke
`ocx-mirror` directly — never `ocx run -- ocx-mirror`, which pins
`OCX_BINARY_PIN` to the bootstrap `ocx` and false-reds the nested push.

## The binaries claim

yq ships as a raw binary, so the bundle's only PATH entry is a bare
`${installPath}` — the executable *is* the content root. `bin_scan` only looks
*below* an `${installPath}/<dir>` entry, so `auto`/`verify` is rejected at spec
load with exit 65. `mirror-base.yml` therefore sets `bin_scan: off` and
`yq/metadata.json` hand-lists `binaries: ["yq"]` — the blessed shape for this
asset type.

## Required secrets

| Secret | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `OCX_ANNOUNCE_TOKEN` | opens the index pull request from the `ocx-contrib/index` fork |
| `OCX_MIRROR_DISCORD_HOOK` | notify-stage Discord webhook URL |

(Inherited from the `ocx-contrib` org with visibility ALL. GHCR pushes use the
run's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no registry secret needed.)
